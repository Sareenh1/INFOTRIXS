# INFOTRIXS
Week-1 Task


Monolithic Architecture:
Pros: Simplicity, easier to manage.
Cons: Scalability challenges, single point of failure.

Microservices Architecture:
Pros: Scalability, fault isolation.
Cons: Increased complexity, potential communication overhead.
Choose the architecture that best fits your application's requirements. Monolithic may be simpler for smaller projects, while microservices provide more flexibility for larger and scalable applications.
